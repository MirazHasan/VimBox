# vim-fakeMap

Plugin for VimBox that allows configuring mappings for one platform, and then
allowing other platforms/environments to reuse those mappings defining "swaps".

For example, you can configure a mapping in your `settings.json` as:

    "@special all:<D-S>": "command:DoSave",

Which would work well on Mac (as command save), however, `D-` bindings aren't
even available on other platforms or when running in some terminals.
`fakeMap` allows you to swap the meaning of `<D-S>` on a per-platform basis,
while VimBox reads your `.json` settings. It doesn't make Vim understand that
swap, but instead you can think of it as turning your `settings.json` into a
template where certain regions are replaced per platform/environment.

It can be easier to use this `fakeMap` then to define per platform/gui keymaps
for each platform/keybinding.

For example, to make it so that `<F2>` will trigger any of your VimBox `<D-s>`
bindings, edit your `settings.terminal.json` and enter the following:


    {
      "*": {
        "fakeMap": {
          "mappings": {
            "<F2>": "<D-s>"
          }
        }
      }
    }

Then if you open the VimBox autogenerated .vimrc file (via command `:Rc`) you
will see that any binding that used `<D-s>` is now replaced with `<F2>`.

This is a great utility for defining a personal configuration on your main
platform and then making it easy for your config to be used on alternative
platforms. You can use all your existing `<D-s>` keybindings, including their
nuanced mode bindings - all you have to do is state which key should act as
`<D-s>`.


### TODO:
When swapping *to* mappings such as `<F12>` we may need to automatically inject
in a `@special` attribute.

      @special all:<D-\>
